First mount the Samba share



When you are in Finder you can click Go and Connect to Server or you can type Command + K to get to the same menu.



In Server Address you will need to put the location of you Windows share with this format smb://server/share where server is the name or IP address of your Windows machine and share is going to be the folder or drive you want to mount.


If your Windows share requires authentication it will ask you for that info here.


Now if you have Connected Servers showing on your desktop, it will show up on your desktop an in Finder.
